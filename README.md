+ Array in other languages - VARRAY in PL/SQL: Collection of items of same datatype & has a maximum size. 
+ When defining a VARRAY type, you must specify its maximum size. So fixed upper bound. Subscript is integer (i.e. index) starts from 1
+ VARRAY is always dense (consecutive subscript). You cannot delete an item in middle, but we can trim elements from end. 
+ Preferred when no of elements known & accessed using  sequence i.e. index
